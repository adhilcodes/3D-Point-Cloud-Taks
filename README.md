# 3D-Point-Cloud-Taks

### In `segmentation.py`:

we will deal with the “floating elements” through Euclidean Clustering (DBSCAN) followed by Voxel Grid Downsampling.

### In `Bounding_box.py` : 

 - LOADING POINT CLOUD
 - VOXEL GRID DOWNSAMPLING
 - RANSAC
 - CLUSTERING USING DBSCAN
 - 3D BOUNDING BOX
